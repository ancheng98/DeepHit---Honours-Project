Title: "Analysis of DeepHit"

Author: Cheng, Andrew

### Description of Code

- To see paper, view 'thesis-paper.pdf' above.
- https://github.com/chl8856/DeepHit for original code. This code is modified to run on additional synthetic data sets generated to test the robustness of the algorithm. This was supervised by Professor Steele at McGill University.
- UNIFORM_RESULT are the resulting Brier and C-Index scores on each synthesized dataset
