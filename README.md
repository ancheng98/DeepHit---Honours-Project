# Deep Learning Survival Algorithm
Title: "Analysis of DeepHit"

Author: Cheng, Andrew

### Description of Code

- https://github.com/chl8856/DeepHit for original code. This code is modified to run on additional synthetic data sets generated to test the robustness of the algorithm. This project is completed for MATH 470 (supervised by Professor Steele) at McGill University.
- To see paper, view 'DH_Analysis.pdf' above.
- UNIFORM_RESULT are the resulting Brier and C-Index scores on each synthesized dataset
